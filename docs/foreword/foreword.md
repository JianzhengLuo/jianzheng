## Foreword

Dear there,  
How are you?

I am [Jianzheng Luo](https://github.com/JianzhengLuo). A middle school student from China. I had the idea to write this package in late 2021 ---- when I knew [Google](https://github.com/Google) developed [MediaPipe](https://github.com/google/mediapipe). Using [CPython](https://github.com/python/cpython) it can run on my computer quite fast by only using CPU. But there is few docs of it. I want to encapsulate it, like [Django](https://github.com/django/django) encapsulate [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask). I am enriching it with some fast-to-use APIs and some graphical tools. Maybe it will take a lot of time, and this **package maybe won't be finished forever**. But I really like programming. I think that I will try my best.

Best wishes,  
Jianzheng Luo
